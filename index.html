    <p class='lead'>My name is Tiffany Love. I am someone who has a passion for working with people and finding meaning in the work that I do. I have spent my professional career collaborating with others to define and work towards a common goal. </p>
    <p class='lead'>After discovering how technology can be used to help others have access to people and tools that allow them to pursue goals and make their dreams a reality, I decided to attend Prime Digital Academy and learn software development.
        I hope to use the skills I have built here in combination with the strengths I have built over my career to work on projects that affect and improve the experiences of people, and allows them to expand beyond their boundaries.</p>
